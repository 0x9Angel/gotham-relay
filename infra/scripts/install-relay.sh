# install-relay.sh — one-command, AUTONOMOUS Gotham mixnet relay installer.
#
# For volunteer relay operators on ANY Ubuntu/Debian host — a public VPS, a home
# box with a port-forward, OR a machine behind CGNAT / mobile 4G-5G / broken UPnP
# (it auto-falls back to RFC B3 rendezvous mode, keeping an OUTBOUND tunnel to a
# public rendezvous relay — no public IP or port-forward needed). No source
# build: it downloads the prebuilt, checksum-verified relay binary and wires up
# auto-enrollment so the relay joins the network on its own.
#
# USAGE (run as root) — no token needed, enrollment is open, but you MUST name
# yourself so the network is allowed to route through you (see GOTHAM_OPERATOR):
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x9Angel/gotham-relay/main/infra/scripts/install-relay.sh | sudo GOTHAM_OPERATOR=your-name bash
#
# or, after cloning the repo:
#   sudo GOTHAM_OPERATOR=your-name bash infra/scripts/install-relay.sh
#
# CONFIG (environment variables):
#   GOTHAM_OPERATOR       REQUIRED. Public nickname identifying who runs this
#                         relay. Path selection refuses two hops it cannot PROVE
#                         belong to different operators, so an unlabelled relay
#                         is never routed. Use the SAME value on every relay you
#                         run, so diversity reflects who actually runs what.
#   GOTHAM_ENROLL_TOKEN   Only if the authority runs in closed/token mode.
#                         Enrollment is OPEN by default — you do NOT need one.
#   GOTHAM_AUTHORITY_URL  Directory authority base URL.
#                         Default: http://144.24.205.188:8443
#   GOTHAM_EXTRA_AUTHORITY_URLS
#                         Space-separated ADDITIONAL authorities to enroll with.
#                         Clients need a quorum of attestations, so the default
#                         is the other two authorities of the shipped set.
#   GOTHAM_TIER           entry | mix | exit. Default: mix
#                         (a middle hop sees neither sender nor recipient —
#                          the safest role for a volunteer).
#   GOTHAM_PORT           UDP listen + advertise port. Default: 443
#   GOTHAM_ADVERTISE_IP   Public IP peers reach you on. Default: auto-detected.
#                         Set this explicitly if you port-forward UDP behind NAT.
#   GOTHAM_RENDEZVOUS     auto | on | off. Default auto: use a rendezvous point
#                         (RFC B3) when no reachable public address is found —
#                         this is what lets a 4G/5G / CGNAT box be a relay.
#   GOTHAM_COUNTRY        ISO 3166-1 code to publish (e.g. FR). Optional.
#
# What it does:
#   1. Installs minimal deps (curl, ufw, ca-certificates)
#   2. Creates the `gotham` system user (no shell, no home)
#   3. Downloads + sha256-verifies the latest `gotham-relay-linux-x86_64`
#   4. Generates an X25519 identity key if one doesn't exist
#   5. Writes the relay config + installs a hardened systemd unit
#   6. Opens the firewall (SSH + your UDP port), starts the service
#   7. Waits until enough authorities have attested the relay, and says so
#      honestly when they have not
