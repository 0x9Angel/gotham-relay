# install-relay-macos.sh — one-command Gotham mixnet relay installer for macOS.
#
# Downloads the checksum-verified prebuilt binary (Apple Silicon or Intel),
# generates an identity key, and installs a launchd LaunchDaemon so the relay
# is boot-persistent and auto-restarts. Run with sudo.

#
# Env vars (same as the Linux installer):
#   GOTHAM_OPERATOR      REQUIRED. Public nickname identifying who runs this
#                        relay. Path selection refuses two hops it cannot PROVE
#                        belong to different operators, so an unlabelled relay
#                        is never routed. Use the SAME value on every relay you
#                        run, so diversity reflects who actually runs what.
#   GOTHAM_ENROLL_TOKEN  Only if the authority runs in closed/token mode.
#                        Enrollment is OPEN by default — you do NOT need one.
#   GOTHAM_AUTHORITY_URL Directory authority URL. Default http://144.24.205.188:8443
#   GOTHAM_EXTRA_AUTHORITY_URLS
#                        Space-separated ADDITIONAL authorities to enroll with.
#                        Clients need a quorum of attestations, so the default is
#                        the other two authorities of the shipped set.
#   GOTHAM_TIER          entry|mix|exit. Default mix.
#   GOTHAM_PORT          UDP listen+advertise port. Default 443.
#   GOTHAM_ADVERTISE_IP  Public IP peers reach you on. If UNSET, the relay
#                        auto-maps its port and detects its public address via
#                        UPnP-IGD (home routers) — no manual port-forward.
#   GOTHAM_RENDEZVOUS    auto | on | off. Default auto: enrol via a rendezvous
#                        point (RFC B3) when no reachable public address is
#                        found — lets a Mac on 4G/5G / CGNAT be a relay.
