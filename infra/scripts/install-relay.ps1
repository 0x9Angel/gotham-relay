  install-relay.ps1 — one-command Gotham mixnet relay installer for Windows.

  Downloads the checksum-verified relay .exe, generates an identity key, and
  registers a Scheduled Task that launches the relay IN THE BACKGROUND AT EVERY
  BOOT (as SYSTEM, before login, no window) with auto-restart on failure — so
  after the PC is shut down and turned back on, the relay comes back on its own.
  Opens the Windows Firewall for the UDP port.

  Run in an ELEVATED PowerShell (no token needed, enrollment is open, but you
  MUST name yourself so the network is allowed to route through you):
    $env:GOTHAM_OPERATOR='your-name'
    irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x9Angel/gotham-relay/main/infra/scripts/install-relay.ps1 | iex

  Env vars (same as the Linux/macOS installers):
    GOTHAM_OPERATOR      REQUIRED. Public nickname identifying who runs this
                         relay. Path selection refuses two hops it cannot PROVE
                         belong to different operators, so an unlabelled relay
                         is never routed. Use the SAME value on every relay you
                         run, so diversity reflects who actually runs what.
    GOTHAM_ENROLL_TOKEN  Only if the authority runs in closed/token mode.
                         Enrollment is OPEN by default - you do NOT need one.
    GOTHAM_AUTHORITY_URL default http://144.24.205.188:8443
    GOTHAM_EXTRA_AUTHORITY_URLS
                         Space-separated ADDITIONAL authorities to enroll with.
                         Clients need a quorum of attestations, so the default is
                         the other two authorities of the shipped set.
    GOTHAM_TIER          entry|mix|exit (default mix)
    GOTHAM_PORT          default 443
    GOTHAM_ADVERTISE_IP  optional; if unset the relay auto-maps its port and
                         detects its public IP via UPnP-IGD (home routers).
    GOTHAM_RENDEZVOUS    auto | on | off. Default auto: enrol via a rendezvous
                         point (RFC B3) when no reachable public address is
                         found - lets a Windows box on 4G/5G / CGNAT be a relay.

carry a single packet.
