//! Send one sealed test message through a running Gotham testnet.
//!
//! Reads the relay set from a signed `directory.json` (as produced by
//! `scripts/local-testnet.sh`), builds a real Gotham client, and routes a
//! sealed packet through the tier-selected 3-hop path. Run the testnet with
//! `RUST_LOG=debug` and watch the three relay logs show the packet traverse
//! entry → mix → exit ("delivered locally" on the exit hop).
//!
//! The standalone `gotham-relay run` daemons carry no delivery handler, so
//! nothing is handed to a recipient app — the point here is to prove the
//! inter-process 3-hop route works against real, separately-running relays.
//!
//! Usage:
//!   cargo run -p crypto-gotham-relay --example testnet_send -- <directory.json>
